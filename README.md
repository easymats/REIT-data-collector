# FII Data Collector

This repository was made to handle a [scientific initiation](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inicia%C3%A7%C3%A3o_cient%C3%ADfica_j%C3%BAnior) project.

In Portuguese, *FII* stands for "*Fundos de Investimento Imobiliário*". It's like Real Estate Investment Trusts (**REIT**), but is from Brazil. Although this document is in English, a fraction of the given name it's in Portuguese, because of the differences between US REIT and Brazil *FII*.
